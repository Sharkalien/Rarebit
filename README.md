# NeoComix (pre-alpha)

## CURRENT FEATURES:
* all on one html page but every comic page gets its own url by appending domain name with query
* page navigation including FIRST, PREVIOUS, NEXT and LATEST buttons, both above and below comic
* alternatively, clicking on a page takes you to the next one.
* ALTERNATIVELY alternatively, arrow keys and A/D also navigate through pages (W and S also scroll vertically)
* The page will automatically scroll to where the comic is when you navigate between pages, to prevent having to scroll past the site's header/banner every time (toggleable)
* choose whether first comic is displayed first or latest comic is displayed first by changing a single value
* choose file extension, name, directory
* give each page its own unique alt text
* support for segmented pages (pages split into two or more separate image files placed vertically), mainly for those migrating from webtoons
## NEEDED FEATURES:
* maybe a top navbar to make it super easy to make custom pages
* archive page and possible automation of it
