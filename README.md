# NeoComix

## CURRENT FEATURES:
* navbar including first, previous, next and latest buttons
* all on one html page but every comic page gets its own url by appending domain name with query
* choose whether first comic is displayed first or latest comic is displayed first by changing a single value
* choose file extension, name, directory
* clicking on a page as an alternate way to take you to the next one
* arrow keys and A/D also navigate through pages (W and S also scroll vertically)
## NEEDED FEATURES:
* support for segmented images (two images on one page)
* navigation on both top and bottom
* maybe a top navbar to make it super easy to make custom pages
* archive page and possible automation of it
* make it so you dont have to manually update maxpg every time you update
* unique alt text support?
